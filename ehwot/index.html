      <h1>EhWot – Text encoding made simple</h1>

      <p>
        EhWot is a small tool with a big personal history behind it.
        It was the first app that eventually led to the creation of
        PeacheyByte Studios, and the idea goes all the way back to my
        early days learning about computers.
      </p>

      <p>
        When younger, a lifetime ago, I spent a lot of time exploring Usenet,
        message boards, and the simple tricks people used to share text
        in fun or unusual ways. ROT-N, ASCII shifts, little ciphers,
        Pig Latin, Morse code.
      </p>

      <p>
        EhWot started as a small project to recreate that feeling while also
        learning the art of app development. The result was a compact,
        no-nonsense encoder and decoder that captures the spirit of earlier
        days while using the tools of today.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app supports a range of quick conversions – ROT-N, binary,
        hexadecimal, reverse, and Morse code – with more to
        come over time. It’s fast, lightweight, and designed to be
        something you can open, use instantly, and close again without
        any fuss.
      </p>

      <p>
        EhWot isn’t meant to be a cryptography or security tool.
        It’s a nostalgic nod to the early days of the internet, when
        people shared and taught each other things, and
        experimented just to see what they could make computers do.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’ve used The Collection Curator, the companion app, or
        anything else from PeacheyByte Studios, this is where it all
        began.
      </p>
