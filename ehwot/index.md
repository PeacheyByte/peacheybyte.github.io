## EhWot – Text encoding made simple

EhWot is a small tool with a big personal history behind it. It was the first app
that eventually led to the creation of PeacheyByte Studios, and the idea goes all
the way back to my early days learning about computers.

When younger, a lifetime ago, I spent a lot of time exploring Usenet,
message boards, and the simple tricks people used to share text in fun or unusual
ways. ROT-N, ASCII shifts, little ciphers, Pig Latin, Morse code.

EhWot started as a small project to recreate that feeling while also learning the
art of app development. The result was a compact, no-nonsense encoder and decoder
that captures the spirit of earlier days while using the tools of today.

The app supports a range of quick conversions – ROT-N, binary, hexadecimal,
reverse, and Morse code – with more to come over time. It’s fast, lightweight,
and designed to be something you can open, use instantly, and close again without
any fuss.

EhWot isn’t meant to be a cryptography or security tool. It’s a nostalgic nod to
the early days of the internet, when people shared and taught each other things,
and experimented just to see what they could make computers do.

If you’ve used The Collection Curator, the companion app, or anything else from
PeacheyByte Studios, this is where it all began.
