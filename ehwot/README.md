## EhWot – Text encoding made simple

EhWot is a small tool with a big personal history behind it.  
It was the first app that eventually led to the creation of PeacheyByte Studios,  
and the idea goes all the way back to my early days learning about computers.

When younger, a lifetime ago, I spent a lot of time exploring Usenet,  
message boards, and the simple tricks people used to share text  
in fun or unusual ways — ROT-N, ASCII shifts, little ciphers,  
Pig Latin, Morse code.

EhWot started as a small project to recreate that feeling while also  
learning the art of app development.  
The result was a compact, no-nonsense encoder and decoder that  
captures the spirit of earlier days while using the tools of today.

The app supports a range of quick conversions:

- ROT-N  
- Binary  
- Hexadecimal  
- Reverse  
- Morse code  

More formats will be added over time.  
EhWot is lightweight, fast, and designed to be something you can open,  
use instantly, and close again without any fuss.

EhWot isn’t meant to be a cryptography or security tool —  
it’s a nostalgic nod to the early days of the internet,  
when people shared, experimented, and taught each other  
just to see what they could make computers do.

If you’ve used **The Collection Curator**, the companion app,  
or anything else from PeacheyByte Studios,  
this is where it all began.
